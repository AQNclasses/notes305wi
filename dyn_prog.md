## Making the Best of It: Efficient Backtracking?

- (Show schedule)
- Recall we started with counting and recurrences to find our resource usage function $T(n)$
  - Counting for imperative code
  - Recurrences for recursive code
- Example: Fibonnaci numbers


\startformula
F_n =
 \startmathcases
  \NC 0 \NC n = 0 \NR
  \NC 1 \NC n = 1 \NR
  \NC F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \NC otherwise \NR
 \stopmathcases
\stopformula
