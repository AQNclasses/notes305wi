- Flowchart of algorithm analysis


## Parts of an algorithm analysis

1. Problem description: if needed, write down problem to be solved, including
all assumptions and constraints.
2. Algorithm description: concise pseudocode
    - Aiming for no more and no less detail than required
3. Proof of Correctness
    - reduction to known problem
    - induction
    - direct proof
    - proof by contradiction
4. Analysis of resource usage
    - Runtime: exact and asymptotic
    - Sometimes: space
