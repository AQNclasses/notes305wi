# Heap Sort

## Heaps

- A (binary) heap can be considered a nearly complete binary tree.
- Tree is filled on all levels except possibly the last, which must be filled
from left to right.
- Can be stored in arrays

## Max- and min-heaps

A max-heap $A$ must satisfy the condition

$$
A\[parent(i)\] \geq A[i]
$$
